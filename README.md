## üìä Migration Management with [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/)

In this project, the Flyway library was utilized for managing database migrations. This decision was made for several reasons:

| Reason                                      | Description                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automation of Database Schema Management**| Flyway allows for easy management of changes to the database structure, providing the ability to roll back to previous versions. This is especially useful during development and testing. |
| **Ease of Dependency Management**           | The first migration was created to establish the necessary tables with dependencies, simplifying interaction between various entities of the application. |
| **Data Initialization**                     | The second migration was used to add an administrator to the database, allowing for immediate access to a user with necessary privileges right after deployment. |
| **Simplification of Deployment**            | Using Flyway simplifies the deployment process of the application across different environments, as all migrations are applied automatically. |
